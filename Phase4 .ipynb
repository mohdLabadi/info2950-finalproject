        "Movies are a fusion of artistic creativity and audience appeal, with various factors contributing to their identity. Among these, the runtime and title length can significantly shape a film's perception and reception. This investigation delves into the IMDb dataset to explore whether movies from different genres are more influenced by their runtime or the length of their titles. By analyzing these patterns, the study seeks to uncover how genres balance storytelling duration with the impact of a compelling title, offering insights into the subtle ways film characteristics align with genre expectations and audience engagement. We also hope to discover patterns related to how the public audience interacts with these movies, do they vote more for movies with longer titles or longer runtimes? How does this interplay change when we change the genre of the movies? How does belonging to multiple genres affect the patterns observed in movies categorized under a single genre?\n"

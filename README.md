#Introduction:
Sometimes, a good movie becomes successful due to unusual factors that people resonated with. For some movie makers focusing on the story telling and the actual movie is as important as these "unusual factors" and for others these are just a mere choice that wouldnt matter in the movie market. Some of these factors include the expected earnings of a movie, a movie's length (to avoid losing the audience’s attention), advertising strategies. While individual preferences may vary, it’s interesting to analyze whether audiences have preferences on factors like these that influence their movie choices and the factors that contribute to their movie selections.

This project will utilize one of the largest publicly available movie datasets, the IMDb public non-commercial dataset, to explore the relationship between these factors. The dataset, which is regularly updated, contains information on over 9 million titles, including feature films, short films, TV shows, web series, and video games. Its extensive scope provides a comprehensive foundation for conducting thorough and insightful research.

This research project will primarily focus on four key aspects of movies:

Runtime: This refers to the "runtimeMinutes" column in the dataset, which specifies the duration of each movie in minutes. The values are positive integers that indicate the total runtime of a movie, providing a clear measure of its length.

Rating: This is the "averageRating" column, representing the IMDb rating each movie gets. The users will rate each movie title with whole numbers from 1 to 10, and the IMDb ratings are based on an average weighted system to ensure fair representation of user opinions. With the system, factors like the credibility of users and the number of votes can also influence the weighting.

Genre: This is the "genres" column, representing the movie genre. There are different genres collected in IMDB, including Action, Adventure, Animation, Biography, Comedy, Crime, Documentary, etc. There might be one or more genres associated with each movie, depending on editorial judgment, filmmaker classification, and community feedback.

The main focus of this research is to examine how a movie's runtime affects its IMDb ratings across different genres, and to explore whether this relationship has changed over time. While factors such as advertising or star power can influence a movie's reception, we chose to focus on runtime because it represents a more objective aspect of a movie experience. Runtime is a neutral factor that is part of the movie’s structure, influencing both the initial expectation (based on title and length) and the lasting impression left after viewing.

Genre plays an important role in shaping audience expectations, as different genres may result in different responses to runtime. For example, an Action movie might be expected to have a fast-paced, shorter runtime, while a Drama may benefit from a longer, more immersive experience. This research seeks to determine whether runtime and genre are significant factors in shaping IMDb ratings and, ultimately, if filmmakers can use these factors strategically to enhance audience engagement and movie impact.

By analyzing these patterns, the study aims to provide insights into how characteristics like runtime and genre affect audience perceptions and whether they should be considered when making decisions about movie production, marketing, and distribution. The research will address the following central question: How do runtime and genre influence movie ratings, and can these factors provide actionable insights for filmmakers and studios? More specifically, do audiences recieve a movie's runtime differently depending on gerne? How do these patterns vary over time?

The setting of this analysis is significant as it offers insights into the subtle ways in which film characteristics align with genre expectations and audience engagement. Understanding how these factors influence movie reception can have practical implications for movie marketing, production, and audience targeting.

Furthermore, this research can serve as a valuable tool for filmmakers, enabling them to strategically position their movies to align more effectively with audience preferences and genre expectations, eventually leading to improved feedback, greater audience satisfaction, and enhanced box office or streaming performance. For instance, if longer runtimes are associated with higher ratings in epic or historical genres but negatively impact audience reception in comedies, filmmakers can make informed decisions about movie length to align with audience expectations.
